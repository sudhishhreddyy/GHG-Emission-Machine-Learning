üåç Harnessing Machine Learning for Proactive Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecasting
This repository contains the complete implementation and documentation of our research project: "Harnessing Machine Learning for Proactive Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecasting: A Step Towards a Sustainable Future." The project presents a comprehensive, multi-model machine learning framework designed to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using historical environmental and energy consumption data from the EDGAR database (1970‚Äì2023).

üß† Key Highlights
Multi-Model Framework: Utilizes Linear Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Ensemble Learning: Combines predictions from all models using weighted averaging to enhance forecasting accuracy.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Robust data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and imputation strategies to ensure model compatibility.

Hyperparameter Optimization: GridSearchCV for Random Forest, Bayesian Optimization for ANN and LSTM
Evaluation Metrics: Models are evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R¬≤ Score.
Visualizations: Actual vs. predicted emissions, sector-wise and country-wise analysis, and top contributors to global GHG.

üìä Dataset
Sourced from the EDGAR 2024 GHG Booklet, including:
GHG totals by country
GHG by sector and country
GHG per capita and per GDP

üîç Use Cases
Environmental Policy Support: Data-driven insights for targeted climate action and mitigation strategies.
Energy Management: Identifies key emission sources across sectors like power, transport, industry, and agriculture.
Forecasting Emissions: Accurate predictions for sustainable planning and international climate agreements.
